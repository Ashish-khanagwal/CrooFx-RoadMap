# 🧠 CrooFx RoadMap

This repository documents the day-to-day evolution of [**Croofx**](https://github.com/croovi-org/croofx) — a deterministic AI execution control layer between LLMs and production systems.

It serves as:

- 📚 A structured learning journal
- 🏗 An architectural decision log
- 🧪 A record of experiments
- 📈 A roadmap tracker
- 🔍 A transparency layer for building in public

---

## 🚀 What is Croofx?

Croofx is a deterministic AI execution engine that:

- Understands repository structure
- Controls LLM context
- Validates AI-generated patches
- Enforces deterministic outcomes
- Introduces governance around AI-assisted code changes

> [Join The Waitlist](https://www.croovi.com/)

Core thesis:

> We are building determinism around probability.

AI guesses.
Croofx enforces.

## 🧱 Guiding Constraints

- Deterministic output by default
- No patch applied without validation
- Stable JSON ordering
- No hidden randomness
- Governance > hype
- Structure > speed
- Control > convenience

---

## 🛠 Built In Public

This repository reflects the raw, iterative journey of building Croofx.

Not polished marketing.
Not theoretical thinking.
Execution.
